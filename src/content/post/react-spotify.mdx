## Resume

Full stack web app to visualize personalized Spotify data with the help of Node.js, React, Styled Components, and the Spotify Web API.

Following the instructions of the course [Build a Spotify Connected App](https://www.newline.co/courses/build-a-spotify-connected-app).

## Client

- Build out a professional, responsive user interface with React, React Hooks, React Query, and the popular CSS-in-JS library, Styled Components.
- Pull in data from the Spotify API using modern ES6 async/await methods and display that data in an engaging way.
- Use Storybook for building UI components and pages in isolation.
- Use Mock Service Worker as API mocking library. This library uses Service Worker API to intercept actual requests.
- Use Zod as TypeScript-first schema validation with static type inference.
- Use Vercel Serverless Functions to handle the authentication flow.

## Server

- Apply the basics of REST APIs, HTTP requests, and OAuth.
- Authorize an app with Spotify.
- Build a Node server with the Express framework to handle our authentication requests
