I few days ago I started a migration of a project from ES6 to Typescript.

The main job is doing by a few configuration files.

---

## tsconfig.json

- The most important file.
- This one tell to the Typescript compiler `tsc` in what way and which files need to compile.

```json
{
	"compilerOptions": {
		"target": "es2015",
		"declaration": true,
		"sourceMap": true,
		"moduleResolution": "node",
		"declarationDir": "./public",
		"allowSyntheticDefaultImports": true
	},
	"include": ["src/**/*"]
}
```

## webpack.config.js

- The Webpack configuration only has one plugin: <a href="https://github.com/TypeStrong/ts-loader">ts-loader</a>
- The `ts-loader` plugin apply the configuration of `tsconfig.json` and execute the Typescript compiler.
- This task will be called later by the build and the dev scripts (both of them stored on package.json)
- So, for resuming:
  - `ts-loader` will compile all the `.js` and `.ts` files (from the path `src`) to ES215/UMD format (this project doesnâ€™t need Babel anymore!)
  - And then put the result into the `public` folder:
    ```shell
      public/index.js
      public/index.js.map
      public/types.d.ts
      # and more files...
    ```
  - `index.js` is the file that any app that use the library will consume.

```js
const path = require("path");
const webpack = require("webpack");

const PATHS = {
	src: path.join(__dirname, "./src"),
	dist: path.join(__dirname, "./public"),
};

module.exports = {
	mode: process.env.mode,
	entry: {
		index: PATHS.src + "/index.ts",
	},
	output: {
		path: PATHS.dist,
		filename: "index.js",
		libraryTarget: "umd",
		libraryExport: "default",
		library: "NAME_OF_THE_LIBRARY",
	},
	devtool: "source-map",
	module: {
		rules: [
			{
				test: /\.ts$/,
				loader: "ts-loader",
			},
		],
	},
	resolve: {
		extensions: [".ts", ".js"],
	},
	plugins: [new webpack.IgnorePlugin(/test\.ts$/)],
};
```

## .eslintrc

- The ESLint configuration, for maintain a codebase free of syntax errors and also for follow a common style guide.

### Javascript files

We apply these plugins to the Javascript files:

- `eslint:recomended`
- `jsdoc/recomended`

### Typescript files

We apply these plugins to the Typescript files:

- `eslint:recomended`
- `jsdoc/recomended`
- `@typescript-eslint/eslint-recommended`

```js
{
  "root": true,
  "env": {
    "es6": true,
    "node": true
  },
  "extends": [
    "eslint:recommended",
    "plugin:jsdoc/recommended"
  ],
  "parser": "babel-eslint",
  "plugins": [
    "jsdoc"
  ],
  "parserOptions": {
    "ecmaVersion": 6,
    "sourceType": "module"
  },
  // Temporal workaround because this project will has
  // for a while files in format .js and .ts.
  "overrides": [
    {
      "files": [
        "**/*.ts"
      ],
      "env": {
        "es6": true,
        "node": true
      },
      "extends": [
        "eslint:recommended",
        "plugin:jsdoc/recommended",
        "plugin:@typescript-eslint/eslint-recommended",
        "plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended"
      ],
      "parser": "@typescript-eslint/parser",
      "plugins": [
        "jsdoc",
        "@typescript-eslint"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## .eslintignore

- The ESLint ignore configuration
- You can tell ESLint to ignore specific files and directories.
- In this case we ignore node_modules and public folders.

```js
node_modules;
public;
coverage;
```

---

## package.json

Here you can find all the scripts of the app and also the dependencies and more metadata of the app.

### Build

- `"build": "webpack --mode=production"`
- This script builds the app for the production environment.
- This script will be called later by Gitlab for deploy the app to production (configuration stored on `.gitlab-ci.yml`)

### Dev

- `"dev": "webpack --mode=development --watch"`
- This script builds the app for the development environment.

### Linters

- `lint:js` and `lint:ts `
- Both scripts read the `.eslintrc` file and apply the configuration.
- Both scripts will be called later by Gitlab for testing the app before deploy it to production (configuration stored on `.gitlab-ci.yml`)

### Unit tests

- `test:unit`
- This script compile the library before call Jest.
- This is because, all the unit tests only validate the compiled version of the library.

```json
{
	"scripts": {
		"prepare": "npm run build",
		"build": "webpack --mode=production",
		"dev": "webpack --mode=development --watch",
		"lint:js": "eslint 'src/**/*.js'",
		"lint:ts": "eslint 'src/**/*.ts'",
		"docs": "esdoc",
		"test:unit": "yarn build && jest --notify --verbose"
	}
}
```

## .gitlab-ci.yml

GitLab CI/CD pipelines are configured using a YAML file called <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/">.gitlab-ci.yml</a> within each project.

```yml
stages:
  - test
  - deploy

image: node:latest

before_script:
  - curl -o- -L https://yarnpkg.com/install.sh | bash
  - export PATH=${HOME}/.yarn/bin:${PATH}

cache:
  paths:
    - node_modules/

library test:
  stage: test
  script:
    - yarn
    - yarn test:unit
    - yarn lint:js
    - yarn lint:ts

pages:
  stage: deploy
  script:
    - yarn docs
    - yarn build
  artifacts:
    paths:
      - public
  only:
    - master
```
