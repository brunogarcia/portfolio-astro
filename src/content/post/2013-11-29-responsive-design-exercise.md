Some time ago, I did a exercise for apply a job. This was the exam I made.

I think is a good idea for practice your front-end skills.
So, if you have some time and want a challenge for Sunday morning, you can try on your own to complete the task.

The exercise seem to be very simple (it doesn’t): create the markup of
this design for mobiles, tablets and desktop.

Maybe I’ll improve it soon. I don’t know if the approach was the
correct, but it works in three different devices!.

I have [a repo in Github with the code](https://github.com/brunogarcia/responsive-testing), check it out
too. I used a [responsive tool](https://github.com/mattkersley/Responsive-Design-Testing) created
by [Matt Kersley](https://github.com/mattkersley/), was very useful.
